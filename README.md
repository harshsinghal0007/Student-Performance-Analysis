## 📝 Project Overview

1. **Data Upload**: Load CSV data into Python using pandas.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Verification**: Check for missing values and ensure numeric columns for calculations.  
3. **Analysis**:
   - Calculate average scores for each student across Math, Science, and English.  
   - Assign letter grades (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) based on average scores.  
   - Identify top-performing students.  
4. **Results**: Save processed data in a new CSV file for download.  
5. **Optional Visualizations**: Histogram or bar charts to display score and grade distributions.
